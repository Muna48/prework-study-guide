# <Prework-Study-Guide Webpage>

## Description

The prework study guide webpage was created as a place to store my notes and things learnt during the prework activity of the bootcamp. The motivation behind creating this web page was to practice what I learnt in the prework activity and also have a place where any notes I made were kept so I could refer to them easily.
It helps to make sure that I dont forget what I learnt and that my notes can be accessed easily. So it solves the problem of me forgetting what I leanrt during the activity.
While making this webpage I learnt how to make a simple basic webpage using HTML, Git, CSS, and Javascript. I learnt how to format the website a little bit using CSS and how to use some functions using Javascript.
